# Quantum Entanglement Simulation Algorithm

This repository contains an algorithm that simulates quantum entanglement and superposition for quantum information processing.

## Description

The Quantum Entanglement Simulation Algorithm (QESA) is designed to model and simulate the phenomena of quantum entanglement and superposition. It can be used to explore the fundamental principles of quantum physics and to develop applications in cryptography, quantum communication, and quantum computing.

## Usage

To use the QESA, you first need to import the `quantum_entanglement_simulation` module. Then, you can create a quantum system by calling the `create_system()` function. The `create_system()` function takes parameters defining the quantum system and returns a simulation object.

Once you have created a quantum system, you can manipulate it using the following functions:

* `entangle()`: Entangles two or more qubits.
* `superpose()`: Creates a superposition of states.
* `measure()`: Measures the state of a qubit.
* `simulate()`: Simulates the evolution of the quantum system.

## Example

The following code creates a quantum system and entangles two qubits:

```python
import quantum_entanglement_simulation

system = quantum_entanglement_simulation.create_system(2) # 2 qubits

system.entangle(0, 1) # Entangle the first and second qubits

result = system.measure(0) # Measure the first qubit

print(result) # Output will be the measured state
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the Quantum Entanglement Simulation Algorithm is available in the `docs` directory of the repository.
